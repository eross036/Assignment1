   <p>Dalí was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work.
   His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters.
   His best-known work, The <i>Persistence of Memory</i>, was completed in August 1931.
   Dalí’s expansive artistic répertoire included film, sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.</p>
